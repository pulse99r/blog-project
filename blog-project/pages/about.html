                <h2>Influences:</h2>
                <p>I have been influenced by a number of different musical genres throughout my life.  My first influence was church music.  Then there was folk music. That was followed by the music of the Beatles, and the Brit Invasion.  That was followed by music of the big rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Jefferson Airplane and Starship, Journey, Yes, The Who, Chicago, Kiss, and many others.  That was followed in college by the jazz artists, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and others.  I'm still a mostly jazz player today, however I also still love rock and roll and my performances and recordings include all the music to which I've been exposed.</p>
