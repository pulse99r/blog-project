                <div><h3>Learn To Read and Play Notes</h3>
                    <p>There is no better way to increase your level of enjoyment than to expand your ability to comprehend  and express yourself using musical terminology. A person never really needs to learn to fully express their emotions.  However, if you think about it, you probably know people who are lost in social situations because they are uncomfortable expressing their emotions.</p>

                    <h3>Make Practice a Daily Habit</h3>
                    <p>If you want to live a healthy lifestyle, and keep your weight at an optimal level, lower you blood sugar level, have more energy and feel great, etc., you would make healthy eating a daily activity.  You might even hire a health coach for guidance to keep you motivated to stay in practice.  Mastering the guitar is no different.  Practice everyday means you <u>read</u> some notes, <u>play</u> some chords, get your fingers working, sing-along with yourself or other musicians. Even <u>listening</u> to music you enjoy and intend or dream of learning to play can be considered practice. If you are studying by yourself, get a beginners book and go through one page per week; being sure to practice that one page every day for 7 days, before moving on to the next page. And if you are challenged or put off by the word <u>practice</u>, substitute the word &quot<strong>play</strong>&quot.</p>
                    <blockquote cite="https://www.emoovio.com/guitar-quotes/">You cannot just wake up one day and expect to know everything already. When you want to learn something, then it is going to take some time first. With time and passion, you can quickly learn how to play guitar. The thing that matters the most is that you are trying to learn this skill, and it will bring you the fruit that you are looking for in the future..</blockquote>

                    <h3>Don’t Allow Yourself To Get Discouraged</h3>
                    <P>Once you get discouraged, you will either quit trying, or get stuck at a certain level.  If your guitar is sitting in a closet with more dust on the case than a saloon floor, you’ve quit. Given up.  It’s over.  If your guitar is out, but you find yourself saying, “I’m good enough, I don’t need to learn any more”, you’re stuck at the level you’re at.  Either way, you have allowed yourself to get discouraged!  Start by remembering what you love about playing the guitar, what songs really turn you on and return to playing them as often as you can.  Then return to practicing something new, and making practice a daily habit</P>
                    <div>
                    <h3>Listen to Live Musicians Play</h3>
                    <P>Go out to local places that host live jam sessions and listen to other musicians play and join them on stage if you can.  If you aren’t able to join them right away, use that as incentive and as a milestone for studying, practicing and developing your skills, till you <strong>CAN</strong> join them on stage.</P>

                    <h3>Get An Acoustic Guitar</h3>
                    <p>If you have only an electric guitar, it will limit your practice time. Because it needs to be set up each time you’re ready to practice, I’ve found that it reduces the amount of time people will practice.  If you have to go find the amplifier, plug it in, tune the guitar, find the right amplification setting, avoid your neighbors' complaint(s) about too much noise, you’re likely to really hate practice.  With an acoustic guitar, you can just grab it, tune it up and start playing without disturbing the neighbors!  Get the most expensive  guitar you can afford to get,  If you need advice, get it from a friend whose knowledge of the guitar you respect or who’s guitar playing you like, or from a guitar teacher, <strong>not</strong> from the guy in the guitar store.</p>
